	<b>Cellebrite</b> was established in Israel in 1999 by <b>Avi Yablonka, Yaron Baratz and Yuval Aflalo.</b>

<b>Ron Serber</b> Joined Cellebrite at <em>Dec 2000 as VP R&D</em> and <b>Yossi Carmil</b> in <em>Aug.2004 as CEO</em> and later on Ron and Yossi share the CEO title, and now as co-CEO.

Cellebrite's first manufactured hardware and software offered a compressive phone-to-phone data transfer devices and offered contact synchronization and content transfer tools for mobile phones, intended for use by wireless carrier sales and support staff in retail stores.

Initially Cellebrite's commercial products were used as a tool for migration from IS-95 (CDMA) enabled mobile phones to the GSM standard. Later, Cellebrite Wireless Carriers & Retailers' Universal Memory Exchanger (UME) gained additional data extraction and transfer capabilities, as well as additional mobile phone diagnostics, backup, and application management and delivery.

In 2007 Cellebrite established an independent division targeted at the mobile forensics industry. Cellebrite's Mobile Forensics introduced mobile forensics products in 2007 under the family brand name <b>'Universal Forensic Extraction Device' (UFED)</b>, with the ability to extract both physical and logical data from mobile devices such as cellular phones and other hand-held mobile devices, including the ability to recover deleted data and decipher encrypted and password protected information.

Also in 2007, Cellebrite was acquired by FutureDial Incorporated and one of its major shareholders, Sun Corporation in Japan.[3] Today it is a fully owned subsidiary of Sun Corporation. </p>

<h2 style="border:2px solid Tomato; font-style:arial; text-align: center;">How does it work?</h2>

 <ol style="background-color:orange; font-size: 150%; text-align: left;">
  <li>Ask whether the mobile phone will be kept or given back to the owner.</li>
  <li>Once declared, always keep in mind the safety precautions.</li>
  <li>If ever it will be returned to the owner, don't forget to use gloves for your protection. Make sure that the front cam and rear cam has a cover to avoid yourself from being captured.</li>
  <li>Open the UFED.</li>
  <li>Connect the mobile device to the UFED with its appropriate connector.</li>
  <li>Connect your external device on the other side of the device. This is where you put all the extracted data.</li>
  <li>Run the device.</li>
  <li>There might be additional steps to be done, as what the UFED might recommend, follow them thoroughly.</li>
  <li>You'll get to choose what kind of extraction are you going to do; whether Logical, File System or Physical Extraction - Choose appropriately.</li>
  <li>Wait until the task is completely done.</li>
  <li>Once it is finished, pull off your external device and connect it to your analyzer.</li>
  <li>Analyze and look for any evidence/s.</li>
  <li>Make the necessary, logical, brief and honest report.</li>
